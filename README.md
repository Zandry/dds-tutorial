This repository contains the sources for the Data Distribution Service
Tutorial. This is an effort aimed at providing DDS users with a
friendly and in time complete reference to this very powerful data
distribution technology.

The tutorial has been designed to make it easy to add support for new
programming languages. The initial version targets C++ but Java, Scala
and JavaScript will be coming soon.

The C++ version of the tutorial is available [here](http://bit.ly/dds-tutorial-cxx).
